\section{Project Scope}

\subsection{In-scope}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reliability
\item Tunability
\item Overhead
\item Constant changes to services
\item Highly seasonal and noisy patterns 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Building a generalize model
\item few shot learning to convert to a new system
\item Tunability
\item Reponsed to seasonal dependencies 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Out-scope}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Interpretability
\item Use production data to train
\item Very high accuracy
\item Become the Sole monitoring system
\end{enumerate}
