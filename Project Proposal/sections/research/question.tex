\section{Research Question}


\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label=\textbf{RQ\arabic*:}]

\item Can encoding raw data monitoring into an image-like structure can improve the performance of autoencoders?

\item Is it possible for a single machine learning model to extract the underlying function in all of the monitoring data of a microservice?

\item  Can the model me generalize enough so, with few-shot learning, the same model can be set to predict anomalies in a completely different service?

\item Can a weighted graph on anomaly scores be used to predict a root cause of a failure?

\item Can reinforcement learning be applied here so the model is continuously adapting to changes done to host service?

\end{enumerate}
