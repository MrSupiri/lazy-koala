{\let\clearpage\relax \chapter{Development Methodology}}

Even though this project has few clearly defined requirements, designing and developing them will require an iterative model as there isn't a single best way to develop this and the author will be experimenting with different techniques. So author decides on using \textbf{prototyping} as the \ac{sdlc} Model for this project.

\section{Design Methodology}

To design the system diagrams for this project \ac{ooad} methods will be used. \ac{ooad} make it easier to design the system iterative and this complement the choice \ac{sdlc} method Prototyping

\section{Evaluation Methodology}

During the literature, the survey author concluded there ain't any specific evaluation metrics for root cause analysis system other than accuracy and f1 score and there ain't any publicly available dataset or a system to benchmark against. Base-level benchmark will be carried out to compare the proposed system with existing ones.
