To manage task of this project authors decide to use \textbf{Agile PRINCE2}. Agile PRINCE2 built upon waterfall method which works best for projects with fixed deadlines and requirements with the added benefit of having regulated inputs and outputs \citep{WhatAreT79:online}.

\section{Resource Requirement}

\subsection{Software Requirements}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep] 
\item \textbf{Ubuntu / Arch Linux} - Since this project will use \ac{ebpf} as a dependency it will require a Linux kernel based operating system.
\item \textbf{Python / R} - This project has a data science. So using a language with good data science eco-system will make this process easier.
\item \textbf{GoLang / Rust} - While GoLang has official client library made by Kubernetes developers themselves, kube-community has developed an excellent alternative in Rust.
\item \textbf{K3d / Minikube} - To create a Kubernetes cluster locally for development and testing.
\item \textbf{Jetbrain IDEs / VS Code} - IDE provides lot of tools that will help developing complex project like this easily.
\item \textbf{Google Docs / Overleaf}  - To create documation about the project the author can use a usual editor like Google Docs or declaratively tool like Overleaf which use coding like style to format the document.
\item \textbf{Google Drive / Github} - Offsite location to backup the codebase and related documents.
\item \textbf{ClickUp / Notion} - To manage the project and keep track of things to be done.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item \textbf{Quad-core CPU with AVX support} - AVX is a CPU instruction set which is optimze for vector operations. Having an AVX supported CPU could reduce the model inference time.
    \item \textbf{GPU with CUDA support and 2GB or more VRAM} - Both Tensorflow and Pytorch depend on CUDA for hardware-accelerated training. Training on GPU could save a lot of time increases the number of trial and error iterations that could be done.
    \item \textbf{16 GB or more Memory} - Running a microservices simulation locally will consume a lot of memory and while testing models will get loaded into RAM.
    \item \textbf{At least 40GB disk space} - To store the dataset, models docker containers while developing the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skill Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item \textbf{Experience working with Kubernetes} - The author will be developing a Kubernetes extension so they need to know the inner workings of Kubernetes.
    \item \textbf{Data engineering} -  Developing a data encoding technique requires a lot of knowledge in how to manipulate a given dataset.
    \item \textbf{Model engineering} - Creating model from ground up is difficult task. So the author needs to have an in-depth idea about a machine learning framework and how different layers in the model work in order to fit them properly. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep] 
\item \textbf{Monitoring dataset} -  This dataset can be collected using \hyperref[microsim]{MicroSim} tool author plan to develop to simulate distributed system.
\end{itemize}
