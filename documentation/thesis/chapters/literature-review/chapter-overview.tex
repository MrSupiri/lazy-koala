\section{Chapter Overview}

Since most research projects are continuation or different approaches to existing problems, one of the first most crucial steps in conducting research is to conduct a literature survey. This usually has to be done to understand the problem domain, currently published work about the problem, established methods of solving target and related problems, tools and technologies that can be used, and last but not least, evaluation methodologies for that particular problem. So in this chapter, the author will discuss how this problem came to be, what are the different components needed to be developed, and why and finally conclude the chapter with possible approaches and tools that can be used to solve the aforementioned problem.
