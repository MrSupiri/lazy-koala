    \textbf{Social} & \textbf{Legal} \\ \hline
 Throughtout the both requirement elicitation phase and the evaluation phase, several interviews have been carried out. The interviewee's name was included to provide credibility for the author's claims. The author reached out to them and obtained their written consent and only included the names of those who agreed to publish their name in this research project. & several open-source libraries and tools were used to simplify the development. All the licenses that came with those, were properly cited within the code base along with references to original sources. Finally, it was decided to publicize this project under the MIT licenses as well as a token of gratitude to the FOSS community. \\ \hline

    \textbf{Ethical} & \textbf{Professional} \\ \hline

One of the most prominent ethical issues that rise during the research process is plagiarism.  All the literature which was used to compile this document was cited properly to prevent this. On the implementation side, even the smallest code snippets that were taken from a third-party source were properly cited to the original sources in order to provide the credit where credits are due. & Since this project is meant to be extended by other researchers, implementation was done following software engineering best practices such as code commenting and generalizations. Additionally, the testing and the evaluation of the project were done with a system that closely resembles the real-world scenarios and the collected data was present without any manipulation. \\ \hline
