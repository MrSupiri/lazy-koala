\section{Testing Setup}

Since the system is designed to integrate with an existing microservice system the author needed a way to simulate the conditions of such a system with an emphasis on predictability and reliability. So to achieve that the author himself created a tool called \href{https://github.com/MrSupiri/MicroSim}{MicroSim}. This leverages the extensibility of Kubernetes to provide a simplified API to the user to deploy a predictable microservice system.
