\section{Objectives and Goals of Testing}

The testing process in SDLC is to see whether all the key components are working as expected in order to call the project a success. Following are the key points that will be tested to see if the system is performing as planned.


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    % \item Validate whether the \ac{lazy-koala-operator} parses the monitor request accuratly and schadule all the child recouses correctly.
    % \item Validate whether the \ac{gazer} and \ac{sherlock} parses the config updates from to updates from \ac{lazy-koala-operator} accuratly.
    % \item Validate whether the \ac{gazer} is collecting the telemetry data from the services accuratly.
    % \item Validate whether the \ac{sherlock} aggragate the service telemetry correctly.
    \item Validate all three components of the system work both individually and cooperatively to achieve the end goal.
    \item Understand how the system works on edge conditions.
    \item Identify if there are any potential Performance bottlenecks.
    \item Uncover any bugs or missing features that were left out during the implementation.
    \item Ensure all the must-haves and should-haves of the systems are implemented correctly.
\end{itemize}
