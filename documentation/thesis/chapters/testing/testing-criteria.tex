\section{Testing Criteria}

A criterion is defined for testing the system in two ways with the goal of closing the gap between the expected and implemented systems.

\noindent The two methods of testing are as follows:


 \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Functional Quality - This focuses on the system's development characteristics and required technical aspects to see if it fits the given design based on functional requirements.
    \item Structural Quality - This tests the system's nonfunctional requirements while ensuring that it meets the performance requirements.
\end{itemize}
