\section{Limitations of the Testing Process}

One of the main issues faced during the testing process is the lack of a proper benchmarking system and standard testing method to evaluate the performance of a framework like this. Therefore, the author has to come up with a method to evaluate this system. Another critical issue that could have strong implications was that the entire system was trained and tested on synthetic data, although the system shows strong indications it could adapt to real-world data, there may be more tuneing that needs to be done to work well with a production-level system.
