\section{Contribution to the Body of Knowledge}

\subsection{Technical Contribution}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/MrSupiri/MicroSim}{MicroSim}} - A tool to create a simulated distributed system within a Kubernetes Cluster. This tool also consists of a load generator which can create semi-random traffic patterns.
    \item \textbf{Lazy-Koala} - A Kubernetes native toolkit that provides a flexible API for collecting telemetry with zero instrumentation. This also helps to integrate any anomaly detection model into a system with minimal effort.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Domain Contribution}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{Data Encoding Technique} - This project introduced a novel data encoding technique that uses the RGB colour spectrum to represent telemetry data from different sampling windows. This helps both humans and machine learning models to understand the status of services.
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Neural Network} - To accompany the encoded data, a convolutional neural network was developed to detect anomalies. This model was trained on a large dataset of telemetry data collected from different services, which was built on a different framework. It helped to make the model very generalisable and easy to fine-tune per-service basis.
