\section{Future Enhancements}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item As mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:literature-review} microservices tend to change over time. Extending \ac{lazy-koala-operator} to automatically fine-tune the models would help overcome this problem.
    \item \ac{gazer} currently only works with low-level socket metrics. Adding support for more complex metrics, such as error rates returned from service, on the application layer could boost the accuracy of detections.
    \item With the current implementation \ac{lazy-koala-operator} polling every deployment every minute to verify changes in pods IPs. Moving this to the pub/sub model will make the system react faster.
    \item Even though the model provided with \ac{sherlock} can detect anomalies with a fair bit of accuracy. There is a lot of optimisation that can be done to improve the accuracy of the model. For example, introducing LSTM cells could lead to better recall of past data.
    \item Supporting sharding in \ac{sherlock} will help with the deployment in larger environments so that the service could to be split across multiple \acp{vm}.
