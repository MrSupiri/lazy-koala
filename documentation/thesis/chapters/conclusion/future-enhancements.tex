\section{Future Enhancements}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item As mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:literature-review} microservices tend to change over time. Extending \ac{lazy-koala-operator} to automatically fine-tune models would help to overcome this issue
    \item \ac{gazer} currently only works with low-level socket metrics. Adding support for more complex metrics like error rates returned from service on the application layer could boost the accuracy of detections.
    \item With the current implementation \ac{lazy-koala-operator} polling each and every deployment every minute for check changes in pods IPs. Moving this to the pub/sub model will make the system react faster to changes.
    \item Even though the model provided with \ac{sherlock} can detect anomalies with a fair bit of accuracy. There is a lot of optimization that can be done to improve the accuracy of the model. For example, introducing LSTM cell could lead to better recall from past data.
\end{itemize}
