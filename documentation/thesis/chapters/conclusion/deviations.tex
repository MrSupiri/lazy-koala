\section{Deviations}

The initial idea for this project was solely forced on the machine learning aspect to create a machine learning model that is highly specialized in service anomaly detection. But during prototyping, the author found out about the lack of infrastructure around \ac{aiops}. So, the scope of the project was broadened to include all the telemetry collection and processing steps too.
