    \textbf{Module} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Programming Principles 01 and 02, Object Oriented Programming & During these three modules we were taught about ways of design and development process of software. Knowledge gained about software design concepts such as use case diagrams and flowcharts were reused to complete the chapter 6 of this thesis. \\ \hline
    Software Development Group Project & During this we were tasked with coming up with a novel idea to design and develop a system from ground up. So to achieve that we were taught how to follow SDLC along with proper documentation. \\ \hline
    Algorithms: Theory Design and Implementation & This module laid the foundation for us to help in terms of time and space complexity instead of solely relying on the results. Learnings from this module were taken to optimize the both CPU and memory footprint of the system. \\ \hline
    Applied AI & Applied AI module was forced on applying concepts of artificial intelligence to real world problems. Learnings from this module were used when developing the \ac{sherlock} module. \\ \hline
