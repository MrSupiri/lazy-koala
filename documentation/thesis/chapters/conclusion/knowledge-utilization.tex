    Programming Principles 01 and 02 & 
    Knowledge gained about software design concepts such as use case diagrams and flowcharts were reused to complete chapter 6 of this thesis. 
    \\ \hline

    Software Development Group Project & 
    During this we were tasked with designing and developing a system from ground up. So, to achieve that, we were taught how to follow SDLC along with proper documentation. 
    \\ \hline

    Algorithms: Theory Design and Implementation & 
    This module laid the foundation for us to help in terms of time and space complexity instead of solely relying on the results. The learnings from this module were taken to optimise both the CPU and memory footprint of the system. 
    \\ \hline

    Applied AI & 
    Applied AI module was forced on applying concepts of artificial intelligence to real world problems. The learnings from this module were used when developing the \ac{sherlock} module.
