\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this thesis, the author proposed a collection of tools that can collect, store and process telemetry data from a distributed system to detect anomalies within the system. The system was demonstrated to several technical experts from both local and foreign organizations during the evaluation phase. They all shared their sentiments and stated that the research outcome has excellent potential if marketed correctly. Few of them were impressed with the author's accomplishments while working on this project and had sent offers to join their organizations. Finally the author hopes to open source the entire project under the MIT license so that both DevOps and data science communities can build on this to push the boundaries of \ac{aiops}.
