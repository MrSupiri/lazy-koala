\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this thesis, the author proposed a collection of tools that can be used to collect, store and process telemetry data from a distributed system to detect anomalies within the system. During the evaluation phase, the system was demoed to a number of technical experts from both local and foreign organizations. All of them shared the sentiment around this, and could've a lot of potentials if marketed correctly. Few of them were impressed with the author's accomplishments while working on this project and had sent offers to join their organisations. At the end of the project, the author hopes to open source the entire project under the MIT license, so that both DevOps and Data Science communities can build on this to push the boundaries of \ac{aiops}.
