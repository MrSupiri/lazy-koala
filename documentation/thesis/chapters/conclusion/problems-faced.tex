\section{Problems and Challenges Faced}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{Scope of the project} - Since this project touches both cloud computing and deep learning there was a massive area to be explored.
    \item \textbf{Learning Curve of \ac{ebpf}} - As an optimization step the author decided to opt-in for using one of Linux Kernal's subsystems called \ac{ebpf}. This forced the author to learn some of the inner workings of the Linux Kernel which is written in C.
    \item \textbf{Learning curve of Kubernetes} - Using Kubernetes itself is categorized as a hard skill to master. In order to complete this project author had to extend Kubernetes itself to provide tight integration to provide the best user experience.
    \item \textbf{Cost to association with Kubernetes} - This project can not be deployed into the Kubernetes development environment since the \ac{gazer} requires direct access to a Linux Kernal. So the other had to use a production-grade Kubernetes cluster hosted in Google Cloud.
    \item \textbf{Economic Crisis} - With the end of COVID-19, Sri Lanka was faced with a massive economic crisis. Due to this, there were power cuts that lasted 10 hours at times. This made the author lose a lot of pressure on working hours while sitting idle.
