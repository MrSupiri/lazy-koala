\section{Research Motivation}

Modern distributed systems generate tons of useful and useless telemetry data. As the demand and size of the system increases, these telemetry data become more nosier and more complex \citep{Untangli35:online}. It makes difficult for humans to understand all these data, especially if they do not have long-standing experience with the system. On the other hand, deep learning models thrive when they have no end of data to learn from. As these models can be trained in computer-simulated environments, they can learn concepts that humans need years to grasp, within days \citep{OpenAI_dota, silver2017mastering}. Finally, unlike humans a deep learning model can monitor a service 24x7 without taking any breaks which will not only prevent outages even before they happen, It could be reduced \ac{mttr} because the issue can be detected way earlier than any human could do.
