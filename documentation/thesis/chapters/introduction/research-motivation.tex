\section{Research Motivation}

Modern distributed systems generate tons of useful and not so useful telemetry data. As the system grows in demand and size, these telemetry data only get nosier and complex \citep{Untangli35:online}. It's difficult for humans to make sense of all these data, especially if they don't have a lot of years of experience with the system. In the other hand, deep learning models thrive when it has a lot of data to learn from. As these models can be trained in computer-simulated environments they can learn concepts humans takes years to grasp within days \citep{OpenAI_dota, silver2017mastering}. Finally, unlike humans a deep learning model can monitor a service 24x7 without taking any breaks which will not only prevent outages even before they happen, It could be reduced \ac{mttr} because the issue can be detected way earlier than any human could do.
