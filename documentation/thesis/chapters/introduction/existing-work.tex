  \cite{du2018anomaly} &
  Tested most of common machine learning methods to detect anomalies and benchmarked them &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Used SLIs to monitored data
    \item A lot of good metrics (input data)
    \item Performance monitoring of services and containers
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Only be able to identify predetermined issues
    \item Require a sidecar that includes a lot of overhead
    \item Won't work with event-driven architectures (this is where most of the new systems are headed)
    \item Uses Supervised learning and it's near impossible to find real-world data with labels
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} \\ \hline
  \cite{kumarage2018anomaly} &
  The authors here are proposing a semi-supervised technique using a Variational Autoencoder to predict future time steps and calculate the difference between predicted and actual to detect anomalies. &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Due to the difficulty of finding labeled research data, they settled on using a semi-supervised technique.
    \item Used randomized decision trees were utilized to select the most suitable features for each component.
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item The model won't be easily transformable for other systems
    \item If more new key features were added to the system it will require a total retraining
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} \\ \hline
  \cite{kumarage2019generative} &
  Uses a bidirectional \ac{gan} to predict future timesteps and uses MSE between prediction and real to determine the anomalies &
  Experimented using a \ac{gan} to detect anomalies rather than using conventional autoencoders &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Accuracy is around 60\% which is not really good to use in production with mission-critical systems.
    \item As this is a \ac{gan}-based system, it may take a lot of resources to run with production systems.
  \end{itemize} \\ \hline
