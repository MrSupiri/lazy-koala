  \cite{du2018anomaly} &
  Tested most of common machine learning methods to detect anomalies and benchmarked them &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Used \acp{sli} to monitored data
    \item A lot of good metrics (input data)
    \item Performance monitoring of services and containers
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Only be able to identify predetermined issues
    \item Require a sidecar that includes a lot of overheads
    \item Won't work with event-driven architectures (this is where most of the new systems are headed)
    \item Uses Supervised learning and it is nearly impossible to find real-world data with labels
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} \\ \hline


  \cite{kumarage2018anomaly} &
  The authors here propose a semi-supervised technique using a Variational Autoencoder to predict future time steps and calculate the difference between predicted and actual to detect anomalies. &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Due to the difficulty of finding labelled research data, they settled on using a semi-supervised technique.
    \item Randomized decision trees used were used to select the most suitable characteristics for each component.
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item The model will not be effortlessly transformable for other systems
    \item If more new key features were added to the system it will require a total retraining
  \vspace{-7mm}
  \end{itemize} \\ \hline


  \cite{kumarage2019generative} &
  Uses a bidirectional GAN to predict future timesteps and uses MSE between prediction and real to determine the anomalies &
  Experimented using a GAN to detect anomalies rather than using conventional autoencoders &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Accuracy is around 60\%, which is unimpressive for use in production with mission-critical systems.
    \item As this is a GAN-based system, it may take numerous resources to run with production systems.

  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Limited to network issues
    \item \acp{sres} must manually identify the issues, although the knowledge graph helped visualisation.

  \cite{chigurupati2017root} &
  Proposed a way to detect hardware failures in servers using a probabilistic graphical model that concisely describes the relationship between many random variables and their conditional independence &
  \vspace{-8mm}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] 
    \item Find hidden meaning in values that seems random
    \item Used a probabilistic approach to understand the relationship between inputs and outputs more clearly
    \item Gives all the possible root causes for a given problem

    \item Only able to identify 3 types of issues
    \item Checks only for performance anomalies
    \item Use the slow response time of a microservice as the definition of an anomaly
    \item Service meshes add a lot of overhead to systems
    \item Required direct connection between services
  \vspace{-7mm}

    \item Require a sidecar
