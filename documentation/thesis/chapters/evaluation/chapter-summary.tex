\section{Chapter Summary}

This chapter discussed the final evaluation of the project by getting outside opinions on the system and analysing those data to see whether the original goals were met during the phase of this research. 
% In order to achieve that evaluation criteria were first defined, then a self-evaluation was done against those criteria. After that, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation was done within those criteria. Finally, both functional and non-functional requirements were evaluated to test whether expectations were met.
