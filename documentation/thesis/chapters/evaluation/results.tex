\subsection{Qualitative Result Analysis}

The following table shows the overall impression of the interviewees after showing the demonstration of the system.


\begin{longtable}{|p{8mm}|p{147mm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Code} & \textbf{Feedback} \\ \hline
    EV1 & “Isala has done a tremendous amount of work in completing this project. It already covers a huge scope with multiple key technologies involved. It is definitely beyond the average projects we see within other undergraduates. Industry is definitely going to benefit from this concept and the prototype.” \\ \hline
    EV2 & “The project is very impressive!” \\ \hline
    EV3 & “Giving feedback and seeing the progress has been a great experience!” \\ \hline
    EV4 & “Isala has done an excellent job. IMO, the scope of the project goes beyond the undergraduate project. Isala has used correct technologies in a correct way to solve the problem he tried to solve.” \\ \hline
    EV5 & “Overall it is a good project. There is a lot of work put behind to create the prototype. Would like to see how it would perform by trying out models with different inputs.” \\ \hline
    EV6 & “This was a creative approach that I don’t know I have seen anywhere else. The architecture is well designed and has appropriate divisions. Separating the metrics aggregation from the analysis was a good choice as these components will scale differently.” \\ \hline
    EV7 & "Keep continuing working on the project. This is something really cool and this could help a lot of startups to solve their problems because the key point in this is you solve the service layer of related issues." \\ \hline
    EV8 & “This looks really good, for specifically undergrad project done in a limited time” \\ \hline
    EV9 &  \\ \hline
