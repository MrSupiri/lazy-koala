\section{Evaluation Methodology and Approach} \label{sec:evaluation-methodology}

Evaluation is vital to the success of any research project. It provides credibility to the claims of the research and its results. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, the author has conducted a series of quantitative interviews with technical experts and domain experts, and has also conducted a qualitative survey to evaluate the system. The foci of these interviews and surveys are to evaluate the system's performance and impact on the real world by gathering data from an outside perspective. During the interviews, the author demonstrates the system's behaviour and different conditions, as well as the thinking process behind each of the features and its implementation.
