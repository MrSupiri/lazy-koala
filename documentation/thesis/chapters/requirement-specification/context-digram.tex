\section{Context Diagram}

Since the proposed system falls into the category of an open system, it communicates with a lot of external parties. It's advised to have a clear system boundary when developing such a system so the development process does not get overwhelming. Figure \ref{fig:context-digram} explains the main interactions between the system and the third parties.
