\section{Context Diagram}

Since this proposed system falls into the category of an open system, it communicates with a lot of external parties. It's advised to have a clear system boundary when developing such a system so the development process doesn't get overwhelming. Figure \ref{fig:context-digram} explain the main interactions between the system and the third parties.
