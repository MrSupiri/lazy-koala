\section{Research Aim}

\textit{The aim of this research is to design, develop and evaluate a toolkit to help system operators to reduce the MTTR when the system is experiencing an anomaly. This will be achieved by using machine learning models to investigate all the services in the system and highlighting the most probable root causes in order, So the operators donâ€™t have to find a needle in a haystack}

In this project the author tries to create a single model that can monitor all the vitals of a given service and output an anomaly score in any given time window. The author is hoping to make it generalized enough so operators can take the same model and deploy it with other services and the model will adopt to the new services using a few-shot learning method \citep{wang2020generalizing}. To do this, author is trying to create a data encoding technique to represent monitoring data in a programming language/framework independent way. To achieve this goal the author is also hoping to create a lightweight service instrumentation pipeline that can collect and process telemetry data in real-time without requiring any additional work from the user's end.
