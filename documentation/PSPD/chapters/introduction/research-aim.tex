\section{Research Aim}

\textit{The aim of this research is to design, develop and evaluate a toolkit to help system operators to reduce the \ac{mttr} when the system is experiencing an anomaly by using a machine learning model investigating all the services in the system and highlighting the most probable root causes in order, So the operators don't have to find a needle in a haystack.}

To achieve this, author tries to create a single model that can monitor all the vitals of a given service and output an anomaly score in any given time window. The author is hoping to make it generalized enough so operators can take the same model and deploy it with other services and the model will adopt the new services with \ac{fsl} \citep{wang2020generalizing}. To do this, author is trying to create a data encoding technique to represent monitoring data in a programming language or framework independent way.

Finally, the author is hoping to develop a playground that easily simulates a distributed system within a Kubernetes cluster so the create system can be tested and evaluated properly and future researches on this domain will have to benchmark framework to evaluate their work.
