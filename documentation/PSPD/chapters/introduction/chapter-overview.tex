\section{Chapter Overview}

% This document was made to provide the necessary context about one of the main pain points that arises when it comes to maintaining distributed systems and a course of actions that could be taken to reduce them. To do that author will first give a brief overview of the target domain and existing steps that have already been taken, then the author talks about shortcomings and improvements that can be made to them. Finally, the document will be concluded with how the author will approach the problem and try to solve it.

Cloud computing is in a steady rise for the past few years due to its scalability and ease of use. With this change, a new programming paradigm called cloud-native was born. Cloud-native applications are often developed as a set of stand-alone microservices yet could depend on each other to provide a unified experience. Even though their microservices bring a lot to the table when it comes to the flexibility it could be a nightmare to operate in production.

In this chapter the author will explain the problem domain of this research project, the specific issue this project is going to address, the motivation behind this project and its objectives and finally, concludes the chapter with novelty of the research and expected research challenges.
